# This branch adds an build-in app "COUNTER" which shows the remaining days until a specific date e.g. deadline. 
This branch was created because I'm not that familiar with GitHub. If anyone interested in helping me bring this into the main branch of blueforcer, please contact me :-)

# Support  
If you want to support my work, I really appreciate your donation!
All the money will be allocated towards purchasing new hardware for testing purposes, software licenses, server costs, and a significant portion will also be set aside for dinners and trips with my wife and kids so that they can continue to endure the many hours I spend programming :)
